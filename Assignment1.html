            <P>My name is <b>Ogbonna Ogochukwu</b>
                and technology is my new found favorite thing. Yes, my love for technology is
                relatively new because I never really cared about computers. I however find that my world is changing
                and it
                facinates me how much impact I can make by getting to know computers better. I also enjoy the
                gratification I get from being responsible for
                the creation of beautiful things. It's amazing how much tech affords me the opportunity to create, coupled
                with the
                unmatched feeling of being part of something important.
                <i>I simply refuse to be left out.</i>

        <section class="section2">
            <!-- <h2>Second section</h2>  -->
            <p>Though somewhat overwehlming at first, the last three weeks has been insighting. I was able to bridge
                most of the
                gaps in my knowledge of html and I equally started my journey into css. CSS is
                <b>important</b>
                because it is
                germane to creating a great user experience and helps to ease the navigation of websites.
                <i>Seeing my simple
                    html pages come alive with styling is definately my favorite part of CSS.</i>
            </p>

            <p><i>Speaking of styling,</i> A <b>padding</b> is a style property which creates a space around an
                element's content inside a defined border. While a
                <b>border</b>property allows you determine what type of border is displayed around an element, the
                <b>margin</b> property creates a space around elements, outside of a defined border.
